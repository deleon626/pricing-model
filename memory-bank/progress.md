# Progress

## What Works
- Core Memory Bank documentation system initialized
- Modular codebase structure in place
- Streamlit UI and core pricing logic implemented
- Detailed plan for quote management improvements established (see quote_management_improvements.md)

## What's Left to Build
- Implement quote management improvements:
  - Save vs. Update Quote logic (in progress)
  - Navigation after loading a quote (in progress)
  - Displaying saved vs. live quote amounts (pending)
  - Customer ID generation improvement (pending)
  - Error handling for file operations (pending)
  - Documentation/user guidance (pending)
  - State persistence/unsaved changes warning (pending)
  - Concurrency support (long-term)
- Expand Memory Bank with feature-specific documentation as needed
- Enhance testing and validation procedures

## Current Status
- Project is in a stable state with foundational documentation established
- Actively working on quote management improvements

## Known Issues
- No major issues identified at this stage
- File-based storage may cause data consistency issues with concurrent users (see improvement plan)

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Emphasis on documentation and modularity established early
- System patterns and technical context are regularly updated as the project evolves
- Recent focus on improving quote management workflow and robustness
